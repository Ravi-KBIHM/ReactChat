# ReactChat

The application we’re going to build will be available on both iOS and Android. The app consists of three screens: sign-up, login, and chat.

We’ll let users sign up and log in with an email and password. For user sign-up and login, we’ll use Firebase Authentication.

The chat will be available for signed-in users only. The messaging functionality will be implemented with the help of the Firebase Realtime Database.

Since we’re creating a simple chat app, we won’t let users create and join groups. All users will be in the same group.


Libraries for Creating the Chat App
Here’s the list of libraries that we’ll use to build the chat app:

firebase – the client-side libraries for applications that use Firebase services
react – a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
react-native – a framework for building native apps with React
react-native-i18n – a library that provides internationalization with React Native
react-navigation ‒ a library that implements navigation logic
react-redux – official React bindings for Redux
redux ‒ a state management library for JavaScript applications
redux-thunk ‒ middleware that returns functions of actions
eslint ‒ a linting utility for JavaScript applications
relative-date – JavaScript module for outputting relative dates
